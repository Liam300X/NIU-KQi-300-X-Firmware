# KQi 300X Scooter Firmware Repository
Repository with firmwares for the NIU KQi 300X  scooter, these files where collected from various places. Also the JSON descriptors values are provided with information like the filename, type and MD5.

You will need to download a modified version of the NIU app from this link for this process to work (uninstall normal NIU app first). https://mega.nz/file/V01TVagK#Mw7OVa8gaJmrQb76mKMFnU3mWu4DmnS30eGigmxLHc4
